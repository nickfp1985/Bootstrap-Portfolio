            <p>My name is Nick Peddie. I have been a poorly self-taught web developer for the last two years, as a hobby. 
                I started officially programming with Java around five years ago to become a software engineer. Some odd things
                happened with the school I was attending and I decided to try my luck elsewhere. Since I made that move, I have 
                been teaching myself html, css, and javascript with the help of online programming courses from a number of 
                different websites; Udacity, Udemy, EdX, and Coursera to name a few.</p>
            <p>I am now attending UCSD's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp in hopes that their career services will teach me how to 
                package myself as the prime candidate for any Full Stack Web Developer position that I know I am. I am very 
                dedicated to become fluent in everything web development to change my career. I have a good job now, but I want
                to have a job in something that I enjoy every day and I that can be achieved with being a Full Stack Developer.</p>
            <p>I am excited about the future and the new opportunities that this UCSD program will open up to me. What I lack in 
                knowledge I make up for with my drive to learn and master new technologies, tools, and programming languages.<br> It 
                certainly helps that I have close friends who have been developers for years that I can call on whenever I need them. 
                Let's do this!</p>
